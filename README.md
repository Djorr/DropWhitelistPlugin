# DropWhitelist Plugin for Minecraft 1.8.8

**DropWhitelist** is a Minecraft plugin designed for PaperMC servers that allows server administrators to manage which items are not dropped upon player death. This plugin helps maintain game balance by preventing specific items from being lost when a player dies.

## Features

- **Whitelist Control**: Easily add or remove item display names and material IDs from the whitelist.
- **Configurable**: Load item names and material IDs from a `config.yml` file for easy customization.
- **Tab Completion**: Commands are equipped with tab-completion for enhanced user experience.
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Informative messages to guide server administrators in using commands.

## Installation

1. **Download the Plugin**: Get the latest version of the DropWhitelist plugin JAR file from the [Releases](https://github.com/Djorr/DropWhitelistPlugin/releases).

2. **Place the JAR File**: Move the JAR file to your server's `plugins` directory.

3. **Restart the Server**: Restart your Minecraft server to load the plugin.

4. **Configure the Plugin**: After loading, a `config.yml` file will be generated in the `plugins/DropWhitelist` folder. Open it to configure the whitelisted items.

## Configuration

The `config.yml` file structure is as follows:

```yaml
# List of item display names that should not be dropped on player death
whitelist-item-names:
  - Diamond Sword
  - Special Axe
  - Enchanted Pickaxe

# List of item IDs (Materials) that should not be dropped on player death
whitelist-item-ids:
  - DIAMOND_SWORD
  - GOLDEN_APPLE
 ```
- You can leave the lists empty ([]) if you donâ€™t want any specific items to be whitelisted.
